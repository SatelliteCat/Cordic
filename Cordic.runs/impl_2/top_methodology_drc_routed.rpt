2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance FIFO_RX_INSTANCE/fifo_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance FIFO_TX_INSTANCE/fifo_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on SWITCHES[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on SWITCHES[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
